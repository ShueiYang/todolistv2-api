# Todolist-V2 project convert into fullstack with React js
 
 Same App from todolist-V1, but this time making a conversion from EJS / Javascript to React ! and separating the front-end (client) and back-end (server) from todolist-V1.

However the client side and server side is still developpe in the same project and become a fullstack application using 4 key technologies : 

* MongoDB : for document Database.
* Express js : back-end Node js web framework.
* React js : front-end Javascript library
* Node js : cross-platform runtime environment to run Javascript code.

Also adding a small end to end test on the server, and a preview date display test on the client: 

* Jest and superTest on server side.
* Vitest on client side with vite.
